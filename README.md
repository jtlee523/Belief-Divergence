## Intro and Summary
This project was created for Silvio Ravaioli's (Columbia Ph.D. Student in Economics) project on Belief Divergence. The repository, when run on oTree, contains two tasks:

Task 1 gives the user urn probabilities and ball probabilities per urn. Then, the participant attempts to report the conditional probabilities of the urn given the result of the ball pulled.

Task 2 gives the user, again, urn probabilities and ball probabilities. However, this time they are also given the option to select a gray urn.
