## 1. Intro and Summary
This project was created for Silvio Ravaioli's (Columbia Ph.D. Student in Economics) project on Belief Divergence. The repository, when run on oTree, contains two tasks:

Task 1 gives the user urn probabilities and ball probabilities per urn. Then, the participant attempts to report the conditional probabilities of the urn given the result of the ball pulled.

Task 2 gives the user, again, urn probabilities and ball probabilities. However, this time they are also given the option to select a gray urn.

Following both tasks is a feedback screen that returns the participants choices along side the correct answers for feedback. Task 2 additionally has a follow up feedback screen that returns the urn selected and feedback.



## 2. Current Version

Current version has a working task pages and feedback pages. Below are current notes that still need to be updated (from last meeting)
[ ] Asthetics of the probability bars
[ ] "given ball" should return the word "white" or "black"
[ ] Accuracy function should be checked
[ ] Payout function should be checked
[ ] Decimals should all show as percentages
[ ] Redo task 2 into 2 pages: first page with just the gray urn, and a second with all the info.
